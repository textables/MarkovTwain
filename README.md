Markov Twain creates the best new quotes from the oldest deadest authors, using the mathmatical system known as a Markov Chain. The creators choose these six specific writers for their unique styles, strong personalities, and clear voices. You can find a new randomly generated quote published every day over on Twitter@markovtwainbot.

This application uses the markov-chains-text, chance, and twit packages, vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS on the front end, node, express, and mongodb on the back end, and jest for testing.
